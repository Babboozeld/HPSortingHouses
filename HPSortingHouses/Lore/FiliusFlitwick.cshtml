                Professor Filius Flitwick (born. 17 October 1958 or earlier) was a part-goblin, part-wizard who attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and was sorted into Ravenclaw House, being an intelligent young man and a model student. Some time after his graduation, Flitwick returned to Hogwarts and became the Charms Master, as well as the Head of Ravenclaw House.
                <br /><br />
                During the First and Second Wizarding Wars, Flitwick opposed Lord Voldemort. In 1995, he also opposed Dolores Umbridge, the High Inquisitor of Hogwarts, and, in 1997, fought at the Battle of the Astronomy Tower, after which he attended the Funeral of Albus Dumbledore. He also protected the students from the Carrows in the 1997-1998 school year. On 2 May 1998, he partook in the Battle of Hogwarts and defeated many Death Eaters.
                <br /><br />
                He survived the war, and likely continued to teach Charms at Hogwarts to future generations of students.
